# employeetracker

This app can be used to keep track of deparments and employees.\
This app can also add, remove, or update employees.\
You can start this app in the terminal cmd line with "node app.js".\
This app uses Mysql database that updates when new data is entered.\
I have attached a quick video of how the app works.\
